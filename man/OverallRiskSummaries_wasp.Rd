\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object containing the results returned by a the \code{kmbayes} function}

\item{y}{a vector of outcome data of length \code{n}.}

\item{Z}{an \code{n}-by-\code{M} matrix of predictor variables to be included in the \code{h} function. Each row represents an observation and each column represents an predictor.}

\item{X}{an \code{n}-by-\code{K} matrix of covariate data where each row represents an observation and each column represents a covariate. Should not contain an intercept column.}

\item{qs}{vector of quantiles at which to calculate the overall risk summary}

\item{q.fixed}{a second quantile at which to compare the estimated \code{h} function}

\item{method}{method for obtaining posterior summaries at a vector of new points. now only support "approx", which is faster particularly for large datasets.}

\item{sel}{selects which iterations of the MCMC sampler to use for inference; see details}

\item{n_subset}{number of subsets to split the data}

\item{n.cores}{number of cores for parallel computing}
}
\description{
Compare estimated \code{h} function when all predictors are at a particular quantile to when all are at a second fixed quantile
